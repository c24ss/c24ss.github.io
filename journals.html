So far in this course, I have learned how to use divs and create styles in HTML. I have also enjoyed learning how to put my website online and the process of creating a website. I am currently working on my website’s homepage. I am excited to create the website and create cool features, but I am a little bit frustrated by it not working occasionally. My goals for the next week or two are to finish my homepage and make it into a real project in which I add doors and different paths. Once I am finished with that, I am excited to start new projects.</p>

Today, I created my CSS animation. Though it was simple, it was interesting to put in specific percentages and timeframes which defined how and where the ball moved. I want to make this more interesting by having the ball spin and adding other components like two people to represent how much I enjoy a day at the beach with friends.

Today I made a function that simply said, "I love apples." I used a variable called food to be the word: "apples" and the a variable called "sentence" to be the words: "i love." This made sense, and I am excited to apply this to my later work with variables.

Today I began my color randomizer using hearts. To do this I used a function in JAVA. I began by making a div using a picture of a heart. I then used variables x,y, and z using RGB to make the color of the hearts random. This took a lot of trial and error using multiplication to create a range for the hearts so that they are most often red or pink.

Today I went over the checklist.
I was unsure of what an array was, so Alex explained it to me, and I recalled doing it in class. Other than that, I decided to work on the Thanksgiving project I made with Avery, and we worked on that for the remainder of the class.

I made my valentines project today. I learned how to use audio tags to make music play using addEventListener. I made tags for all of the songs and all of the letters and coded it such that when I clicked on any of the hearts it would play its own song.
