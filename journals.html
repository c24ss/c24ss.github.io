☆JOURNAL 1☆

So far in this course, I have learned how to use divs and create styles in HTML. I have also enjoyed learning how to put my website on line and the process of creating a website. I am currently working on my website’s homepage. I am excited to create the website and create cool features, but I am a little bit frustrated by it not working occasionally. My goals for the next week or two are to finish my homepage and make it into a real project in which I add doors and different paths. Once I am finished with that, I am excited to start new projects.
